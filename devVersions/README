These are development versions of crossword. 

All have three main functions: (solveHelper, match, solve)

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Current main crosswordSolver: 
solve(wordList) => Solutions. 
word class list -> string list list
(solutions in same order as argument list (or opposite: not entirely sure))
This version does not preprocess the list in any way and uses a single trie for all words. 

The development versions take various approaches in attempts to improve processing efficiency. 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

crosswordV2: Uses separate tries for different length words. 

Alterations:

SolveHelper: 
- receives trieWrapper instead of trie
- selects and passes appropriate trie to match

Match: 
- node.word() check removed: must be 
- maxLength check removed: must be true

Solve:
- receives a word class list * infoWrapper
