Reminder to self:

When you run dev tests, the main crosswordSolver needs to not be running anything - creates collisions. 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#


These are development versions of crossword. 

All have three main functions: (solveHelper, match, solve)

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

main.py is a file to test the various crossword versions. 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

Current main crosswordSolver: 
solve(wordList) => Solutions. 
word class list -> string list list
(solutions in same order as argument list (or opposite: not entirely sure))
This version does not preprocess the list in any way and uses a single trie for all words. 

The development versions take various approaches in attempts to improve processing efficiency. 

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

crosswordV1: Stripped down version of the current main one (without version suffix)
# Note: solution list is backwards relative to given list

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

crosswordV2: Uses separate tries for different length words. 

Alterations:

SolveHelper: 
- receives trie list instead of trie
- selects and passes appropriate trie to match

Match: 
- node.word check removed: must be 
- maxLength check removed: must be true

Solve:
- receives a word class list * infoWrapper

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

crosswordV3: Uses separate tries for different length words. Does an existence check in solveHelper (after next word is matched, to see if the resulting patterns are possible)

Alterations:

SolveHelper: 
- receives the patternDict

Match: 
- same (except for extra parameter passed)

Solve:
- passes different arguments to solveHelper
